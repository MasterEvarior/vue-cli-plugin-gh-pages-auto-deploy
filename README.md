## vue-cli-plugin-gh-pages-auto-deploy

-------

### What this plugin does ?

This plugin automates [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)
deployment by using [Github Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions/about-github-actions).

### How ?
On every push or merge to the `master` branch, your code will be built and pushed
to a branch named `gh-pages`.
So, practically your code will automatically be deployed every time you push on `master`.
